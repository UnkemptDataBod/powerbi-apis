# powerbi-apis
Created due to a frustration that the schema and content of the power bi apis can and do change frequently with issues slow to resolve. 

This is initially to provide a base for schema validation and as a reference for future usage of the APIs. 

The Power BI APIs are not all that are required as the Power BI ecosystem extends beyond the REST APIs as documented [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/power-bi/)
